<h2>Loop control: break, continue, pass</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>Loop control statements are nested inside <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6065" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A loop in Python is a programming construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is met. | It's a way to automate repetitive tasks, making your code more efficient. Loops can be used with iterable objects, such as lists, strings, or dictionaries, and they can be nested or controlled by functions to customize the number of iterations. The two main types of loops in Python are 'for' loops and 'while' loops.">loops</a> and designed to change their typical behavior. In this topic, we'll find out how they work and what they are used for.</p><h5 id="break">Break</h5><p>The <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8244" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'break' is a keyword used within loops to exit the current loop iteration prematurely. | When the 'break' statement is encountered, the loop terminates immediately, and the program continues with the next statement following the loop. It's important to note that 'break' only affects the innermost loop in case of nested loops. Using 'break' can help optimize the execution of your code by avoiding unnecessary iterations when a specific condition is met.">break</a> </strong>statement is used to terminate a loop of any type (i. e. <code class="language-python">for</code><strong> </strong>and <code class="language-python">while</code><strong> </strong>loops). It may be said that <strong>break </strong>"jumps out" of the loop where it was placed. Let’s examine a tiny example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'parrot']
for pet in pets:
    print(pet)
    if pet == 'cat':
        break
</code></pre><p>We wanted to stop the loop before it iterated for the last time. For that purpose, we introduced a condition when the loop should be stopped. The output is as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-python">dog
cat
</code></pre><p>Be careful where you put <code class="language-python">print()</code>. If you put it at the loop’s <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6842" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, 'end' is a parameter that can be passed to the print function to specify what character should be printed at the end of the output. | By default, the print function adds a newline character ('\n') at the end of the output, but you can change it to any other character or string by using the 'end' parameter. For example, you can use 'end =  ' to print all the output on the same line.">end</a>, the output will return only the first value – ‘dog’. This happens because <strong>break </strong>exits from the loop immediately.</p><p>Often enough, <strong>break </strong>is used to stop endless <code class="language-python">while</code> loops like this one:</p><pre><code class="language-python">count = 0
while True:
    print("I am Infinite Loop")
    count += 1
    if count == 13:
        break</code></pre><p>Let's consider how break works in <code class="language-python">for...else</code> or <code class="language-python">while...else</code> statements. <code class="language-python">else</code> statements will be executed if no <code class="language-python">break</code> is encountered during the execution of the loop. Look how it works in the examples below!</p><pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 5:
        print("It's 5!")
        break
else:
    print('5 was not listed')
# 5 was not listed</code></pre><p>In this case, the body of the <code class="language-python">else</code> statement is executed because no <code class="language-python">break</code> was met. Let's change the <code class="language-python">number</code> list.</p><pre><code class="language-python">numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
for num in numbers:
    if num == 5:
        print("It's 5!")
        break
else:
    print('5 was not listed')
# It's 5!</code></pre><p><code class="language-python">break</code> was met, so the <code class="language-python">print()</code> command after <code class="language-python">else</code> wasn't executed.</p><h5 id="continue">Continue</h5><p>The <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11680" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="'Continue' in Python is a loop control statement that allows you to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next one. | It is often used when specific conditions need to be met, and the current iteration does not fulfill those conditions. By using 'continue', you can avoid unnecessary processing and efficiently manage the flow of your loop. It's important to note that 'continue' does not terminate the loop entirely; it only skips the current iteration and moves on to the next one.">continue</a></strong> operator is commonly used, too. You can stop the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/6065" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Iteration in Python refers to the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met or a specified number of repetitions is reached. | It can be categorized into definite iteration, where the number of repetitions is predetermined, and indefinite iteration, where the number of repetitions depends on a specified condition. Python provides built-in tools such as loops and iterators to facilitate iteration. Loops can be used to iterate over iterable objects, and iterators can be created from iterable objects to access their elements one by one.">iteration</a> if your condition is true and return to the beginning of the loop (that is, jump to the loop's top and continue execution with the next value). Look at the following example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'parrot']
for pet in pets:
    if pet == 'dog':
        continue
    print(pet)</code></pre><p>The output will contain all values except the first one ('dog') since it fulfills the condition:</p><pre><code class="language-python">cat
parrot</code></pre><p>Thus, the loop just skips one value and goes on running.</p><p>One nuance is worth mentioning: the <strong>continue </strong>operator should be used moderately. Sometimes you can shorten the code by simply using an <code class="language-python">if</code> statement with the <strong>reversed </strong>condition:</p><pre><code class="language-python">pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'parrot']
for pet in pets:
    if pet != 'dog':
        print(pet)</code></pre><p>In this case, the output will remain the same:</p><pre><code class="language-python">cat
parrot</code></pre><h5 id="pass">Pass</h5><p>When no action is required (e.g. some condition is met, you need to take it into account in a loop, but do nothing if that's the case), in Python, you can use <code class="language-python">pass</code> <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5926" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="A statement in Python is a unit of code that performs a specific action. | It can be a simple statement like an assignment or a complex statement like a function or class definition. Statements are executed sequentially, and each statement can affect the program's state. Python has various types of statements, including control flow statements, which alter the flow of execution, and data manipulation statements, which perform operations on data. Comments are not considered statements, as they are ignored by the Python interpreter.">statement</a> which does exactly what you need – nothing. Here the program is just waiting to be manually interrupted:</p><pre><code class="language-python">while True:
    pass</code></pre><h5 id="summary">Summary</h5><p>To sum up, loop control statements represent a useful tool to alter the way a loop works. You can introduce extra <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5932" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a 'condition' typically refers to a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False. | Conditions are often used in control flow structures, such as if statements, to determine which code to execute based on the result of the condition. For example, an if statement might check if a variable is greater than a certain value, and if so, execute a block of code. The expression being checked (e.g. variable &gt; value) is the condition.">conditions</a> using the <code class="language-python">break</code>, <code class="language-python">continue</code>, and <code class="language-python">pass</code> operators. In addition, they allow you to skip a beforehand selected set of values, terminate an endless loop, or even do nothing. Use them wisely and they'll work wonders.</p>
